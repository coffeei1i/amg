Single-cell spatial transcriptomics and snRNA-seq decoding the organizational principles of functional modules in the mouse amygdala​
1. Project Overview​
This project focuses on deciphering the organizational principles of functional modules in the mouse amygdala by integrating cutting-edge single-cell-resolution spatial transcriptomics, precise anatomical dissection, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) technologies. The amygdala, as a functionally heterogeneous nuclear complex, plays a crucial role in regulating diverse behaviors essential for survival and reproduction. However, the neural mechanisms behind its heterogeneous functions have long been unclear due to gaps in knowledge about its cellular heterogeneity, developmental origins, spatial organization, and gene expression profiles. This study aims to fill these gaps and establish a spatially resolved cellular and molecular framework for further research on amygdalar functions and amygdala-related neuropsychiatric disorders.​
2. Research Background​
The amygdala is a vital part of the brain's limbic system, consisting of multiple subnuclei that work together to coordinate behaviors such as fear response, aggression, and social interaction—all of which are critical for an organism's survival and reproductive success. Despite its importance, the precise neural mechanisms that drive the heterogeneous functions of the amygdala’s subnuclei remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap stems primarily from limited insights into four key areas:​
Cellular heterogeneity: The diversity of cell types within each amygdalar subnucleus and how they differ in structure and function.​
Developmental origins: The embryonic or postnatal sources of cells in the amygdala and how these origins influence cell identity and positioning.​
Spatial organization: The arrangement of different cell types within and across amygdalar subnuclei and how this spatial layout supports functional interactions.​
Gene expression profiles: The patterns of gene activity that define cell types in the amygdala and how these profiles relate to cellular function and subnuclear identity.​
Addressing these gaps is essential not only for advancing our understanding of normal amygdalar function but also for unraveling the mechanisms underlying amygdala-related neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and autism spectrum disorders), where disruptions in amygdalar circuitry and cell function are often implicated.​
