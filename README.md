This project focuses on deciphering the organizational principles of functional modules in the mouse amygdala by integrating cutting-edge single-cell-resolution spatial transcriptomics, precise anatomical dissection, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) technologies. The amygdala, as a functionally heterogeneous nuclear complex, plays a crucial role in regulating diverse behaviors essential for survival and reproduction. However, the neural mechanisms behind its heterogeneous functions have long been unclear due to gaps in knowledge about its cellular heterogeneity, developmental origins, spatial organization, and gene expression profiles. This study aims to fill these gaps and establish a spatially resolved cellular and molecular framework for further research on amygdalar functions and amygdala-related neuropsychiatric disorders.​
